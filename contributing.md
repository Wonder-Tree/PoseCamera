## Open a pull request

These guidelines help maintainers review new pull requests. Stick to the guidelines for quicker and easier pull request reviews.

1. We prefer gradual, small changes over sudden, big changes
2. Write a helpful title for your pull request \(if someone reads only one sentence, will they understand your change?\)
3. Address the following questions in your pull request:
   * What is a short summary of your change?
   * Why is this change helpful?
   * Any specific details to consider?
   * What is the desired outcome of your change?
